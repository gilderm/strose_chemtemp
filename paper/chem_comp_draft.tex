%\section{Title and Author Information}
%Please follow the example in this paper to enter title and author information.
%The title should use title-casing. Please use \texttt{https://titlecaseconverter.com}
%with ``AP'' style to reformat your title.

%\subsection{Citation}
%Appropriately cite all references to other published works included in the paper.
%\texttt{biblatex} is used to create a list of references or bibliography as the
%last section in the paper. Here are citation examples for a
%book\cite{latexcompanion}, a journal paper\cite{einstein}, a
%website\cite{knuthwebsite}, and a conference proceeding paper\cite{maurer}.
%Please check out the source code of this document for details.

%\subsection{Double Quote}
%The proper way to typeset double quote is to use two backticks or grave accents
%(\`{}) on the left and two single quotes (\'{}) on the right, e.g.
%\`{}\`{}Hello!\'{}\'{} for ``Hello!''.

\subsection{Reference List}
The \verb+\printbibliography+ command prints a list of references for you.
Please use \texttt{sample.bib} as an example to create your bibliography entries.

%If you can find a reference on \url{https://scholar.google.com/} you can get a
%``BibTex'' export by clicking on the quotation mark symbol, which is a lot easier
%than entering the information manually.

%\subsection{Code Listings}
%Commands from \texttt{listings} package allow you to display code easily with
%customizable coloring and styling rules. Here is an example.
%Please check out the source code of this document for details.

%\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,  caption=Python example]
%x = 42
%epsilon = 0.01
%step = epsilon**2
%num_guesses = 0
%ans = 0.0
%while abs(ans**2-x) > epsilon and ans < x:
%    ans = ans + step
%    num_guesses += 1
%if abs(ans**2-x) <= epsilon:
%    print(str(ans) +
%    ' is close to the square root of ' +
%    str(x))
%else:
%    print('Failed to find square root of ' + str(x))
%print("The number of guesses is " + str(num_guesses))
%\end{lstlisting}

%\section{Manuscript Submission}
%The following materials will need to be submitted:
%\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
%  \item The final manuscript in Latex.
%  \item Copyright release. It is essential that we receive the copyright
%  release form. By signing this form you are acknowledging that the manuscript
%  has not been printed in another venue, plus you are retaining your rights for
%  use of the manuscript. Read the copyright release. The Consortium will not
%  prohibit you from using the manuscript, but will ask that you credit any reuse
%  to the Consortium as the original source of publication. If you misplace the
%  copyright form, a generic copyright form can be found through the Copyright
%  Release Form\cite{copyright}.\\
%  The Consortium encourages multiple presentations of tutorials and workshops.
%  If you are presenting a tutorial or workshop you may retain the copyright,
%  but we must have that documented. Keep in mind that your manuscript is limited
%  to two pages total. However, you must still submit a copyright form.\\
%  Please note that it is critical that you obtain permission to use third party
%  material. If you use diagrams and such that are attributable to a third party
%  you must obtain formal permission to reprint such items, and must so indicate
%  in the copyright release as well as submit such permission.
%  \item Registration for the conference, along with the appropriate registration
%  fee. We have found that there are some folks in need of publication for
%  promotion and tenure purposes, and then donâ€™t want to present the paper.
%  A major plus of the Consortium conferences is the presentation of the papers,
%  and you must plan on attending. If you do not present the paper at the
%  conference the paper will be removed from the ACM Digital Library.
%  \item A pdf version of your manuscript is most helpful. If there are problems
%  with special characters or special formatting this provides the editors with
%  what you expected your final manuscript to look like. Providing a pdf version
%  or a hard copy helps significantly in envisioning what the author expected
%  the final product to look like.
%  \item Electronic copies of any graphics in a standard format (bitmap, jpeg, tiff).
%\end{enumerate}
