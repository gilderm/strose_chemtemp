An interactive activity was developed to connect computer science and chemistry students, 
allowing both groups to appreciate the applications of computer science to cross-disciplinary fields.  
Computer science majors are tasked with developing an Arduino system to collect and manage thermal 
data generated during laboratory experiments.  Computer science students must employ a range of techniques â€¦. 
Once the system is complete, computer science students work alongside chemistry students to implement their 
program within an introductory chemistry experiment. %s for introductory and upper-level chemistry courses.   
Aside from the collection, 
storage, and visualization of laboratory data, chemistry students benefit by gaining experience managing large data sets and 
an %understanding and 
appreciation for computer science and its increasing value in the natural sciences.
